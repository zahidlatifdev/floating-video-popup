# Floating Video Popup

This project provides an interactive and customizable floating video popup solution. The floating video can be minimized or expanded to full screen, muted/unmuted, and offers replay functionality. Additionally, it integrates with an email submission form to allow users to interact seamlessly.
## Installation

To set up the Floating Video Popup in your project:

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Clone this repository using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/zahidlatifdev/floating-video-popup.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Folder**

   Change to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd floating-video-popup
   ```

3. **Set Up the Project**

   - Open the project folder. You'll find all the necessary files for setup there.
   - There are several HTML files for different versions of Floating Video Popup.
   - Two things are necessary for you to set up the video bubble: `.html` and the `assets` folder.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions step by step:

1. Open any `.html` file you want to use in a code editor and copy all code inside the video bubble comment.
2. Paste your copied code into your `index.html` file anywhere inside the `<body>` tag.
3. Open the `assets` folder and take `[popup.css` (or `popup-rtl.css` for RTL version) from the `css` folder and place it in your `css` folder.
4. Take `video-models.js` from the `js` folder and place it in your `js` folder.
5. You also need to take the `fonts` folder and `icofont.min.css` file and place these in your `assets` folder.
6. Finally, open the `video` folder and place your videos there. Please use MP4 format only. You may convert your videos to this file type from [FreeConvert](https://www.freeconvert.com/).
7. Link the CSS file and JS file from `assets` in your `index.html` file. You are now ready to run!

You are free to customize the video bubble if you want.

## Versions

### V1

Shows an introduction video only.

### V2

Includes a button with an introduction video. The button can be linked to any external or internal link.

### V3

Includes two different buttons, each with different videos, and the option to add extra buttons with external or internal links.

### V4

Includes all features from V1, V2, and V3, plus a contact form. The contact form uses [Web3Forms](https://web3forms.com/). You need to create an access key and replace `YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_HERE` in the markup to receive emails submitted through the form.

### RTL Version

**Floating Video Popup is also RTL supported!**  
If you're creating an RTL-supported website, Floating Video Popup won't cause you any trouble. Use the `popup-left` class to change the direction of its placement to the left. This is already commented in the code.
